                I'm a self taught artist. I usually practice mimicking other 
                art styles till I add my own style to it or feel comfortable 
                that I could add my own style. I'm not that good of a artist 
                that I want to put my art as a wallpaper yet, but I think 
                I'm getting there.

                From the time I was a child, I always enjoy singing. There 
                is a sense of passion when music is being played. Then I joined 
                choir in fourth grade. Singing in a group empowers that feeling of 
                passion as well as add in the feeling of camaraderie. Around sixth
                grade, I learned to play the piano. Piano helped me understand how 
                to read music and sightread.

            <p>
                I adore stories. I always love to read books and any kind of story.
                Stories get us through life with lessons they contain or just get entertain us. 
                Hope is there no matter how small even if you have to pass that hope or story 
                to another. Hope might not shine the brightest or be as obvious, but it's there. 
                A bit of hope maybe for oneself and maybe for those around them, it's worth it 
                to have hope.

                Also, I am a huge Harry Potter fan. Talk to me about anything obscure, I'll probabaly
                know about it.

            <p>
                I am intrigued by the anime medium considering there are so many kinds. I love
                the art style and enjoy the story aspects of anime. Much like how adore stories, 
                I mostly find anime that builds on top of character development, character 
                interactions, and world-building appealing.
